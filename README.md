How to use the software
---
To use the software, we provide a GFF3 file called "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3"; you can download it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vDN4jDmj0oGngcrQ6PrV57931cWBgD6f/view?usp=share_link. When you download the code and the file, make sure that the GFF3 file is inside the "Project-main" folder; otherwise, the software won't be able to use it.
